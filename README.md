# Messenger-new-version

This is my old project - a primitive messenger on Django + WebSockets. It has not been completed and most likely will not be.
There is also a "Messenger-old-version" repository, but it is considered outdated. I had problems with git in it, and I decided to create a new repository (the current one).
I don't know if there are differences between these repositories, but let's assume that this one is newer.
